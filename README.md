# DATA
--  Provided from the projects of Lab 2, being reused for Lab 3.  --

**What is the input?** This dataset has 4 attributes, and an additional field distinguishing whether we go to play tennis, or not. These attributes are as follows: Play Tennis(0 = no, 1 = yes), Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, and Wind (0 meaning low, to 10 meaning high).

**Did you have a meaning for the input feature?** Yes, to decipher whether or not we go to play tennis. :D

**What is the output?** Give a ratio of what attributes cause us to not go play tennis, versus what attributes encourage us to do so.

**How did you find this dataset?** It was provided to me through my second lab in artificial intelligience. 

**How to run your code?** Keep the dataset and the Lab3 file in the same directory, and either through an IDE or command propmt for python, run Lab3, and it should parse the data by itself.
